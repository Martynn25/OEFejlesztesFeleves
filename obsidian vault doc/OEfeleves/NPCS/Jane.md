Backstory: Jane grew up in the city but always dreamed of living a quiet life on a farm. She saved every coin she could and finally bought a small plot of land next to Victor’s farm. She works hard every day, but she still struggles with some things—watering crops properly, keeping animals happy, and waking up early enough to finish all her chores. Despite this, she never gives up and always finds joy in the small moments, like watching a seed sprout for the first time.
