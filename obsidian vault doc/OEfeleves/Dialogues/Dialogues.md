I handle Dialogues with the DialogueManager3 plugin and its exampleDialogueBubble style as it has fit my requirements perfectly, although i see a few needs for customisation (like adding portraits for [[NPCS]] in the dialogues but that is very a much work-in-progress feature and currently not the focus in the project)
