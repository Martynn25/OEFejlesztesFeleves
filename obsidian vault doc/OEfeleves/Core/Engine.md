Godot Engine 4.4 is a powerful, open-source game engine designed for both 2D and 3D game development, with a particular emphasis on flexibility, efficiency, and ease of use. It features a unique node-based architecture that streamlines the development process, making it intuitive for both beginners and experienced developers.

For 2D game development, Godot 4.4 provides a dedicated 2D engine that operates independently of its 3D features, ensuring optimized performance without unnecessary overhead. It includes a rich set of built-in tools for handling sprites, animations, physics, tilemaps, and UI design, allowing developers to create complex 2D games with minimal effort. The engine supports features such as pixel-perfect rendering (that im gonna use in my game), custom shaders, lighting effects, and an advanced animation system with animation trees and blending.

Scripting in Godot is primarily done using GDScript (my chosen language for this project), a lightweight and easy-to-learn language specifically designed for the engine, though it also supports C#, C++, and visual scripting. The engineâ€™s editor is highly customizable, offering a streamlined workflow with built-in debugging tools, real-time editing, and seamless asset management.

Godot 4.4 also supports exporting to multiple platforms, including Windows, Linux, macOS, Android, iOS, and web, making it a versatile choice for 2D game developers. With an active open-source community and continuous improvements, Godot 4.4 remains a top choice for indie developers and hobbyists looking for a free, high-performance game engine with extensive 2D capabilities.

In this project, I use the **DialogueManager3** ([[Dialogues]]) plugin for handling in-game dialogues. It seamlessly integrates with Godot 4.4, allowing for structured, branching conversations with support for variables and conditions. This enhances NPC ([[NPCS]]) interactions and storytelling while keeping dialogue management efficient and flexible.
